# Challenge on Objects and Functions

This coding challenge focuses on creating objects,prototype chain,IIF and closure method.

## Instructions

1. Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include:
   a) question itself
   b) the answers from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data structure here,array,object ,etc.)
   c) correct answer (I would rather use a number for this)
2. Create a couple of question using the constructor.

3. Store them all inside an array

4. Select one random question and log it on the console , together with the possible answers (each question should have a number) (Hint :Write a method for the Question objects for this task )

5. Use the "prompt" function to ask the user for the correct answers . The user should input the number of the correct answer such as you displayed it on Task 4.

6. Check if the answer is correct and print it to the console whether the answer is correct or not (Hint: write another method for this).

7. Suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code .So make sure that all your code is private and doesn't interfere with other programmers code.
